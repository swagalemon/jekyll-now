Lesson review 1

Today we had a cover lesson, I worked with Raphael to achieve the task. The task was to use the fuze box editor to create a code that reads hello world We then started playing around with writing different messages. I think i worked well with Raphael and we did well on the task. I think we could of improved by trying new things and started to look at the handbook for ideas.
